# 👋 Hi, I'm Jakub

> I used AWS before it was cool – to optimize high-demand product releases and maximize profits.  
> Now I design solid systems and websites that run smoothly and look professional – even at 3am. 😌

I got into tech not through textbooks, but by building real things that had to work, really fast.

Back in 2019, as a teenager, I launched a small resale business focused on limited-edition sneakers.  
What started as a side hustle quickly turned into a fully automated online setup – complete with websites, cloud infrastructure, and over 500 successful transactions across Poland and global platforms like StockX and KLEKT.

But I wasn’t just flipping shoes.  
I was designing websites and systems, improving their look and performance, and making sure the user experience felt clean and trustworthy – all before finishing high school.

That early, high-pressure experience taught me what tutorials usually don’t:
- how to deliver when things are on fire,
- how to think in systems and in terms of user experience,
- and how to make tools and websites that quietly do their job while looking great.

**Today I focus on backend, DevOps, and building WordPress websites that are clear, responsive, and aligned with a brand’s image.**

If it runs in the cloud, looks polished, and doesn’t need babysitting – it’s probably my kind of project. 😇
