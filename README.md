# 👋 Hi, I'm Jakub

> I used AWS before it was cool — to automate sneaker drops and maximize profits.  
> Now I just build solid systems that run constantly and quietly - even at 3am. 😌

I got into tech not through textbooks, but by building real things that had to work, really fast.

Back in 2019, as a teenager, I launched a small resale business focused on limited-edition sneakers.
What started as a side hustle quickly turned into a fully automated cloud setup — with EC2 instances like c5a.xlarge, CloudWatch dashboards, real-time alerts, and over 500 successful transactions across Poland and global platforms like StockX and KLEKT.

But I wasn’t just flipping shoes.
I was designing infrastructure, monitoring traffic, tuning performance, managing costs with Budgets and Cost Explorer, and helping others configure their own AWS workflows — all before finishing high school.

That early, high-pressure experience taught me what tutorials usually don’t:
- how to deliver when things are on fire,
- how to think in systems, not just code,
- and how to make tools that quietly do their job while you sleep.

Today I focus on backend and DevOps — building tools that scale smoothly, deploy fast, and stay out of the way.

If it runs in the cloud, sends an alert, and doesn’t need babysitting — it’s probably my kind of project 😇
